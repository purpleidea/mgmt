## Community:
Come join us on IRC in [#mgmtconfig](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#mgmtconfig) on Freenode!
You may like the [#mgmtconfig](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mgmtconfig) hashtag if you're on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/purpleidea).

## Status:
Mgmt is a fairly new project.
We're working towards being minimally useful for production environments.
We aren't feature complete for what we'd consider a 1.x release yet.
With your help you'll be able to influence our design and get us there sooner!

## Questions:
Please join the [#mgmtconfig](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#mgmtconfig) IRC community!
If you have a well phrased question that might benefit others, consider asking it by sending a patch to the documentation [FAQ](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#usage-and-frequently-asked-questions) section. I'll merge your question, and a patch with the answer!

## Quick start:
* Make sure you have golang version 1.6 or greater installed.
* If you do not have it yet create your GOPATH and export it
		
		$ mkdir $HOME/work
		$ export GOPATH=$HOME/work

For more information you can check [GOPATH Documentation](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable).

As a long term solution please add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding this line to your /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation) or $HOME/.profile:

                export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
                export GOPATH=$HOME/work

* Change your working directory to $GOPATH folder `cd $GOPATH`.
* Clone the repository recursively, eg: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/`.
* Go to mgmt working directory `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/purpleidea/mgmt`
* Get the remaining golang dependencies on your own, or run `make deps` if you're comfortable with how we install them.
* Run `make build` to get a freshly built `mgmt` binary.
* Run `time ./mgmt run --file examples/graph0.yaml --converged-timeout=5 --tmp-prefix` to try out a very simple example!
* To run continuously in the default mode of operation, omit the `--converged-timeout` option.
* Have fun hacking on our future technology!

## Examples:
Please look in the [examples/](examples/) folder for more examples!

## Documentation:
Please see: [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) or [PDF](https://pdfdoc-purpleidea.rhcloud.com/pdf/https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Roadmap:
Please see: [TODO.md](TODO.md) for a list of upcoming work and TODO items.
Please get involved by working on one of these items or by suggesting something else!
Feel free to grab one of the straightforward [#mgmtlove](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/labels/mgmtlove) issues if you're a first time contributor to the project or if you're unsure about what to hack on!

## Bugs:
Please set the `DEBUG` constant in [main.go](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/blob/master/main.go) to `true`, and post the logs when you report the [issue](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/issues).
Bonus points if you provide a [shell](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/tree/master/test/shell) or [OMV](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/tree/master/test/omv) reproducible test case.
Feel free to read my article on [debugging golang programs](https://ttboj.wordpress.com/2016/02/15/debugging-golang-programs/).

## Dependencies:
