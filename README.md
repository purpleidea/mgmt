## Status:
Mgmt is a next generation automation tool. It has similarities to other tools in
the configuration management space, but has a fast, modern, distributed systems
approach. The project contains an engine and a language.
[Please have a look at an introductory video or blog post.](docs/on-the-web.md)

Mgmt is a fairly new project. It is usable today, but not yet feature complete.
With your help you'll be able to influence our design and get us to 1.0 sooner!
Interested developers should read the [quick start guide](docs/quick-start-guide.md).
