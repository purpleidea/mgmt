# The bindata target generates go files from any source defined below. To use
# the files, import the generated "bindata" package and use:
# `bytes, err := bindata.Asset("FILEPATH")`
# where FILEPATH is the path of the original input file relative to `bindata/`.
# To get a list of files stored in this "bindata" package, you can use:
# `paths := bindata.AssetNames()` and `paths, err := bindata.AssetDir(name)`
# to get a list of files with a directory prefix.
