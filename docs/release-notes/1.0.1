This is a small release to help out some of the packaging folks.

With that, here are a few highlights from the release:

* We added a standalone "grow" command to the tools sub command.

* The exec resource has a new ifequals param. It also got a nifcmd param.

* A new gsettings resource was added. A new fwattr resource was added too!

* There's an http:server:ui set of resources that have been added. Check out:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vz1MMGkuik for some examples of that in action
and more!

And much more...

NEWS

* You can now easily grow a stack of partition, encrypted volume and filesystem.

* Simple flatpak management is now possible with an mcl class.

* The exec resource grew an ifequals param. This takes even more bash out of the
equation when writing mcl code.

* A new gsettings resource makes management of GNOME settings (and more) very
easy.

* We added nifcmd, nifcwd, and nifshell params to the exec resource.

* A regression in the virt-builder resource was fixed.

* Karpfen improved our func generation for golang 1.25 which helps out the nix
people.

* We added an fwattr resource to manage BIOS settings via the linux
firmware-attributes API.

* SSH world reconnections now work properly and have backoff.

* We now automatically raise inotify limits at startup. This shouldn't hurt
anyone but if you've got a reason you're affected negatively, please let us know
why.

* The user resource wasn't setting all the group things correctly. This is now
fixed. Thanks to user "thijs" for the report.

* We're looking for help writing Amazon, Google, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, etc,
resources if anyone is interested, reach out to us. Particularly if there is
support from those organizations as well.

* Many other bug fixes, changes, etc...

* See the git log for more NEWS, and for anything notable I left out!


BUGS/TODO

* Function values getting _passed_ to resources doesn't work yet, but it's not a
blocker, but it would definitely be useful. We're looking into it.

* We don't have any aarch64 hardware, so no more arm64 builds or testing until
we get a donation or sponsor for that unfortunately.

* We don't have the <|> operator merged yet. Expect that when we do this, we'll
consider removing the || (default) operator. This is the only pending language
change that I know of, and these cases are easily caught by the compiler and can
be easily patched.

* Autoedge performance isn't great. It can easily be disabled. Most of the time
I just specify my edges, so this is really a convenience feature, but it should
be looked into when we have a chance.


TALKS

After FOSDEM/CfgMgmtCamp 2026, I don't have anything planned until CfgMgmtCamp
2027. If you'd like to book me for a private event, or sponsor my travel for
your conference, please let me know.


MISC

Our mailing list host (Red Hat) is no longer letting non-Red Hat employees use
their infrastructure. We're looking for a new home. I've opened a ticket with
Freedesktop. If you have any sway with them or other recommendations, please let
me know:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freedesktop/freedesktop/-/issues/1082

We're still looking for new contributors, and while there are easy, medium and
hard issues available! You're also welcome to suggest your own! Please join us
in #mgmtconfig on Libera IRC or Matrix (preferred) and ping us if you'd like
help getting started! For details please see:

https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/blob/master/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-contribute-to-the-project-if-i-dont-know-golang

Many tagged #mgmtlove issues exist:
https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amgmtlove

Although asking in matrix is the best way to find something to work on.


MENTORING

We offer mentoring for new golang/mgmt hackers who want to get involved. This is
fun and friendly! You get to improve your skills, and we get some patches in
return. Ping me off-list for details.
