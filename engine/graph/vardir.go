// should be cleaned up by the resource on Close if it wishes to discard the
// contents. If it does not, then a future resource with the same kind and name
// may see those contents in that directory. The resource should clean up the
// contents before use if it is important that nothing exist. It is always
// possible that contents could remain after an abrupt crash, so do not store
// overly sensitive data unless you're aware of the risks.
