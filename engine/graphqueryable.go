// GraphQueryableRes is the interface that must be implemented if you want your
// resource to be allowed to be queried from another resource in the graph. This
// is done as a form of explicit authorization tracking so that we can consider
// security aspects more easily. Ultimately, all resource code should be
// trusted, but it's still a good idea to know if a particular resource is even
// able to access information about another one, and if your resource doesn't
// add the trait supporting this, then it won't be allowed.
