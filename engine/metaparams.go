	// worker failure, and only then can we rely on this metaparam. This is

	// which specifies that the resource params are exported into the shared
	// database. When this is true, it does not prevent export. In fact, it
	// is commonly used in combination with Export. Using this option will
	// still include it in the resource graph, but it will exist there in a
	// special "mode" where it will not conflict with any other identically
	// named resources. It can even be used as part of an edge or via a
	// send/recv receiver. It can NOT be a sending vertex. These properties
	// differentiate the use of this instead of simply wrapping a resource
	// in an "if" statement. If it is hidden, then it does not need to pass
	// the resource Validate method step.

	// Export is a list of hostnames (and/or the special "*" entry) which if
