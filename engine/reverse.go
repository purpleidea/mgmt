// ReversibleRes is an interface that a resource can implement if it wants to
// have some resource run when it disappears. A disappearance happens when a
// resource is defined in one instance of the graph, and is gone in the
// subsequent one. This is helpful for building robust programs with the engine.
// Default implementations for most of the methods declared in this interface
// can be obtained for your resource by anonymously adding the traits.Reversible
// struct to your resource implementation.

	// ReversibleRes, because there is no requirement that the reverse of a
	// Res be the same kind of Res, and the reverse might not be reversible!
	// However, in practice, it's nice to use some of the Reversible meta
	// params in the built value, so keep things simple and have this be a
	// reversible res. The Res itself doesn't have to implement Reversed()
	// in a meaningful way, it can just return nil and it will get ignored.
