// SendableRes is the interface a resource must implement to support sending
// named parameters. You must specify to the engine what kind of values (and
// with their types) you will be sending. This is used for static type checking.
// Formerly, you had to make sure not to overwrite omitted parameters, otherwise
// it will be as if you've now declared a fixed state for that param. For that
// example, if a parameter `Foo string` had the zero value to mean that it was
// undefined, and you learned that the value is actually `up`, then sending on
// that param would cause that state to be managed, when it was previously not.
// This new interface actually provides a different namespace for sending keys.
type SendableRes interface {
	Res // implement everything in Res but add the additional requirements

	// Sends returns a struct containing the defaults of the type we send.
	Sends() interface{}

	// Send is used in CheckApply to send the desired data. It returns an
	// error if the data is malformed or doesn't type check.
	Send(st interface{}) error

	// Sent returns the most recently sent data. This is used by the engine.
	Sent() interface{}

// RecvableRes is the interface a resource must implement to support receiving
// on public parameters. The resource only has to include the correct trait for
// this interface to be fulfilled, as no additional methods need to be added. To
// get information about received changes, you can use the Recv method from the
// input API that comes in via Init.

	// SetRecv stores the map of sendable data which should arrive here. It
	// is called by the GAPI when building the resource.

	// Recv is used by the resource to get information on changes. This data
	// can be used to invalidate caches, restart watches, or it can be
	// ignored entirely.
	Recv() map[string]*Send

// Send points to a value that a resource will send.
