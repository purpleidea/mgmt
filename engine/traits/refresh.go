// Refreshable functions as flag storage for resources to signal that they
// support receiving refresh notifications, and what that value is. These are
// commonly used to send information that some aspect of the state is invalid
// due to an unlinked change. The canonical example is a svc resource that needs
// reloading after a configuration file changes.
type Refreshable struct {
	refresh bool

	// Bug5819 works around issue https://github.com/golang/go/issues/5819
	Bug5819 interface{} // XXX: workaround
}

// Refresh returns the refresh notification state.
func (obj *Refreshable) Refresh() bool {
	return obj.refresh
}

// SetRefresh sets the refresh notification state.
func (obj *Refreshable) SetRefresh(b bool) {
	obj.refresh = b
