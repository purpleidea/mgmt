// BuildableFunc is an interface for functions which need a Build or Check step.

// implementing what would appear to be generic or polymorphic instead something
// that is actually static and that still has the language safety properties.
// Our engine requires that by the end of compilation, everything is static.
// This is needed so that values can flow safely along the DAG that represents
// their execution. If the types could change, then we wouldn't be able to
// safely pass values around.

	// form, and must return the type (with the correct arg names) that it
	// will use. These are used when constructing the function graphs. This
	// means that when this is called from SetType, it can set the correct
	// type arg names, and this will also match what's in function Info().
