	Name string

	// Alias is the name identifier that should be used for this import.
	Alias string

	// IsSystem specifies that this is a system import.
	IsSystem bool

	// IsLocal represents if a module is either local or a remote import.
	IsLocal bool

	// IsFile represents if we're referring to an individual file or not.
	IsFile bool

	// Path represents the relative path to the directory that this import
	// points to. Since it specifies a directory, it will end with a
	// trailing slash which makes detection more obvious for other helpers.
	// If this points to a local import, that directory is probably not
	// expected to contain a metadata file, and it will be a simple path
	// addition relative to the current file this import was parsed from. If
	// this is a remote import, then it's likely that the file will be found
	// in a more distinct path, such as a search path that contains the full
	// fqdn of the import.

// aren't working on a downloader for any other frontend at the moment, we'll
// keep it here, and keep it less generalized for now. If we *really* wanted to
