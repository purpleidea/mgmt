# the really tricky case
# XXX: works atm, but not supported for now, error is:
# could not set scope: var `$f1.x2` does not exist in this scope
# We currently re-export anything in the parent scope as available from our
# current child scope, which makes this variable visible. Unfortunately, it does
# not have the correct dependency (edge) present in the Ordering system, so it
# is flaky depending on luck of the toposort.
