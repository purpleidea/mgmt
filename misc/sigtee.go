// This program works exactly like the `tee` program, if it was invoked with an
// implicit --ignore-interrupts argument, and if it also had an --ignore-quit
// argument. These are needed so that it doesn't exit prematurely when called as
// a receiving member of a shell pipeline. This is needed so that a ^C or ^\ can
// cause the sending process to shutdown and relay its data into the tee. Sadly,
// the venerable `tee` program can't currently ignore the QUIT signal.
