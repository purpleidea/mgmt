Welcome to the mgmt hacking VM.

Please make sure that your authorized key for GitHub is added to the SSH agent
on the host machine (see `ssh-add -l`).

You can jump into the mgmt repo with the alias `cdmgmt`.

To get started, try:

$ cdmgmt
$ make clean build
$ ./mgmt run --tmp-prefix lang --lang examples/lang/hello0.mcl`

Enjoy!
